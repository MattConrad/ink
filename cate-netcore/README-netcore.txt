This is a new project, designed for building a .NET Core console app including an exe target.

It is basically a copy of the inklecate source code into a fresh .NET Core project, referencing a modified version of the runtime. There are a few code changes tagged with //CATE-NETCORE.

For this project to build, you also have to make a ton of accessibility changes to the runtime. See the README there for details.
